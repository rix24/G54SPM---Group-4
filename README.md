Game Concept Twist on simon says, the game will consist of a square arena made of 4 coloured squares, the squares will flash in a sequence and the player will have a set amount of time to move the ball to the areas in the sequence indicated. The game will be made more challengning by creating barriers between the areas making it more difficult to move the ball and by lengthening the sequence.
